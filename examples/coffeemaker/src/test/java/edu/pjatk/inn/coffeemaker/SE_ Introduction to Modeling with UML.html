<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	In the mid-1990s, Grady Booch was trying to unify some 
	of the software development methods that were being proffered by different 
	methodologists at the time. The OMT (Object-Modeling Technique) of Rumbaugh <em class="ForeignOrLatin">et al.</em>
 	being the other - his effort seemed one of the more promising (problem 
	statement; three models: object, dynamic, and functional).</li>
 	<li>The unification began and in 1995 the world became aware of the Unified Modeling Language, or UML.
	The original contributors were Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh. "Class" diagrams and statecharts began to stabilize.<br>
	Later, Ivar Jacobson joined in the effort and use cases and interaction diagrams were added.
    </li><li>In 1997 The Object Management Group, or OMG (<a href="http://www.omg.org/" class="URL">http://www.omg.org</a>) took over stewardship of the UML from Rational Software Corporation, where the three authors were all working at that time, and where the UML had originally been developed. The OMG's main prior claim to fame had been the CORBA distributed object standard.
    </li><li>
	<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling_spec_catalog.htm">UML</a> 2 arrived as a Final Adopted Specification in 2003 and replaced UML 1.5 in 2004.
</li></ul>

<h2 class="FM1Heading">
Structure of the UML</h2>
<p class="FirstBody">Four parts comprise the UML:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="Bullet-First-">Infrastructure</li>
	<li class="Bullet">Superstructure</li>
	<li class="Bullet">Object constraint language</li>
	<li class="Bullet">Diagram interchange</li>
</ul>
<div>
	<p class="FirstBody">The 
	<em class="NameOrTitle">superstructure</em>
 of the UML, which is our primary interest, offers standard modeling concepts 
	that enable anyone who understands the superstructure, to create models that 
	other people who understand the superstructure will stand a good chance of 
	interpreting properly. </p>
</div>
<div>


<hr align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade="">


	<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
		The infrastructure doesn't focus on the UML itself; instead it describes the way in which the UML is described, and the way that description is structured into packages 
	and profiles. For example, the most basic elements of modeling are 
	represented core UML and additional layers and profiles tailor existing 
	metamodels toward specific platforms, such as C++, Java, CORBA, or EJB, or 
	domains such as real-time, business objects, or SW process modeling. This layering helps organize the UML,
	and it helps incremental learning as well.<br>
		<img border="0" src="./SE_ Introduction to Modeling with UML_files/infra1.png" width="504" height="223"></li><li>
		A CASE tool can store the information gleaned from its diagrams in a 
		nice sensible schema (logical database structure). What kinds of 
		elements (what tables?) would the database need? That's what the 
		infrastructure tries to tell you, the tool builder, as formally as 
		possible.</li><li>
		The infrastructure tries to ensure that the way the UML is described - 
		the metamodel - is itself compatible with other modeling language 
		descriptions. <br>
		<img border="0" src="./SE_ Introduction to Modeling with UML_files/infra3.png" width="495" height="339"><p>
		The Core packages</p><p>
		&nbsp;<img border="0" src="./SE_ Introduction to Modeling with UML_files/infra2.png" width="550" height="320"></p><p>
		The role of the common Core<br>
&nbsp;</p></li><li>
		The OMG has other metamodel called the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) - the 
		metamodel of the UML. The languages in which languages are expressed are 
		often called metalanguages. The infrastructure of the UML has metamodels 
		of metamodels. A common and helpful picture is the "M n " picture of the 
		layering. Look at Modeling layers (metamodels and meta-metamodels).<br>
		<img border="0" src="./SE_ Introduction to Modeling with UML_files/infra4.png" width="500" height="282"><br>
&nbsp;</li><li>
		All of the UML metamodel is instantiated from meta-metaclasses that are 
		defined in the InfrastructureLibrary.</li><li>
		The UML metamodel imports and specializes all metaclasses in the 
		InfrastructureLibrary.</li><li>
		You do not need to learn the infrastructure - only UML models relevant 
		to your projects, unless you want to be involved in the OMG UML 
		standardization process.<br>
&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>
<div>


<hr align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade="">


	<h2>Object Constraint Language</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p class="FirstBody">The Object Constraint Language, or OCL, is a textual, formal, expression language for rigorously writing constraints using identifiers and values. 
		</p></li>
		<li>
		<p class="FirstBody">Constraints can appear in diagrams, often involving brackets: square for guards and curly for general constraints. Constraints can also express
		<em class="NameOrTitle">preconditions</em>
, <em class="NameOrTitle">postconditions</em>
 and <em class="NameOrTitle">invariants</em>. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p class="FirstBody">Preconditions, postconditions and invariants are 
		particular easy and powerful ways of improving specifications (<i><b>design 
		by contract</b></i>). 
		Preconditions are statements that must turn out to be true before 
		particular things can take place. Postconditions are statements that 
		must turn out to be true after particular things have taken place. 
		Invariants are things that must always hold true when the system is at a 
		stable point, i.e. the elements of the invariant are not actually 
		undergoing change.</p></li>
		<li>
		<p class="FirstBody">The OCL is also used in the UML infrastructure to 
		formally express constraints of the UML metamodel.</p></li>
		<li>
		<p class="FirstBody">The OCL has forAll and exists operators, but they 
		can only be applied to identifiable existing collections. So it has a 
		kind of higher-order logic.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>


<hr align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade="">


	<h2>Diagram Interchange</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p class="FirstBody">The UML lacked a defined way of describing and transporting diagrams with all their layout information.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="FirstBody">UML 2.0 brings an XML-based diagram interchange standard.</p>
		</li>

<h2 class="FM1Heading">
Metamodel Layering</h2>
<p>
The architecture that is centered around the Core package is a complementary 
view of the four-layer metamodel hierarchy
on which the UML metamodel has traditionally been based. When dealing with 
meta-layers to define languages there are
generally three layers that always has to be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the language specification, or the metamodel (mangement),</li>
	<li>the user specification, or the model (domain), and</li>
	<li>objects of the model (carrier).</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure can be applied recursively many times so that we get a 
possibly infinite number of meta-layers; what is a
metamodel in one case can be a model in another case, and this is what happens 
with UML and MOF. UML is a language
specification (metamodel) from which users can define their own models. 
Similarly, MOF is also a language specification
(metamodel) from which users can define their own models.</p>

<h2 class="FM1Heading">
Superstructure of the UML: Diagrams</h2>
<p class="FirstBody">
There are two kinds of diagrams: structure diagrams which represent the way 
things are, and behavior diagrams which represent the way things happen.</p>
<p class="FirstBody">
<img border="0" src="./SE_ Introduction to Modeling with UML_files/omg-super.png" width="650" height="467"></p>
<p class="FirstBody">
The top-level package structure of UML 2.0 Superstructure</p>
<p class="Body">
A diagram requires a border or a title, Diagram frame shows how this is done. The border plus title is known as a <em class="NameOrTitle">
frame</em>
. Some behavioral diagram elements appear on diagram borders - ports or entry/exit points, for example.</p>
<p class="Body">
<img border="0" src="./SE_ Introduction to Modeling with UML_files/empty-frame.png" width="427" height="255"></p>
<p class="Body">
The heading gives the <em class="NameOrTitle">
kind</em>
 of diagram and the <em class="NameOrTitle">
name</em>: <i>[&lt;kind&gt;]&lt;name&gt;[&lt;parameters&gt;]</i><br>
The diagram may have the following <em class="NameOrTitle">
kinds</em>
:</p>
<ul>
	<li>class</li>
	<li>component</li>
	<li>interaction</li>
	<li>package</li>
	<li>state machine</li>
	<li>use case</li>
</ul>
	In addition to the long form names for diagram heading types, the following 
	abbreviated forms can also be used:
	<ul>
		<li>act (for activity frames)</li>
		<li>cmp (for component frames)</li>
		<li>sd (for interaction frames)</li>
		<li>pkg (for package frames)</li>
		<li>stm (for state machine frames)</li>
		<li>uc (for use case frames)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things</h2>
<p><b>Things</b> are the entities of a UML model.</p>
<p>UML things can be partitioned:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>structural</b> things: class, interface, collaboration, use case, active 
	class, component, node</li>
	<li><b>behavioral</b> things (process representation): interactions, 
	activities, state machines</li>
	<li><b>grouping</b> things: package, component</li>
	<li><b>annotational</b> things: a note</li>
</ul>


<hr align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade="">


<h2>Relationships</h2>
<ul>
	<li>UML relationships connect things.<ul>
	<li>A <b>dependency</b> relationship indicates that one element depends in 
	some way on another.</li>
	<li><b>Associations</b> are connections between classifiers.</li>
	<li><b>Links</b> are connections between instances.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Extensibility_Mechanisms">Extensibility Mechanisms</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>UML is extensible modeling language.</li>
	<li><b>Constraints</b><br>
	These extend the semantics of sn element by allowing us to add new rules.<br>
	Constrains are define in OCL.</li>
	<li><b>Stereotypes</b><br>
	These allow us to define a new UML modeling element based on an existing one 
	- we define the semantics if stereotype ourselves.<br>
	(append a stereotype name in guillemets, e.g., «interface»)</li>
	<li><b>Tagged values</b><br>
	These provide a way of extending an element's specification by allowing us 
	to add new, ad hoc information to it.<br>
	{tag1 = value1, tag2 = value2, ... , tagN = valueN}</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Are Verification, Validation, and Accreditation?</h2>
<p>In the context of computer software, the terms verification, validation, and 
accreditation have specific meanings. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Verification is an activity that determines whether the product of each 
	phase of the software development cycle meets the requirements made upon it 
	in each preceding phase, as in the questions <em>"Does the software design 
	satisfy all elements of the requirements?"</em> or <em>"Does the 
	implementation accurately reflect the design?"</em></li>
	<li>Validation is an activity that answers the question, <em>"Is the 
	software suitable for its intended purpose?"</em> Provided the verification 
	activity has been properly performed, that question translates roughly to
	<em>"Does the software meet its requirements when it's run?"</em></li>
	<li>Accreditation is a milestone: when it is reached, the accrediting agency 
	issues a statement that the software product is appropriate for a specified 
	purpose within a well-defined set of circumstances. Accreditation must be 
	done by a respected authority in the field if the software's user community 
	is to have confidence in the software.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that these activities are kept <em>independent</em> of the 
development activity and that they are conducted <em>rigorously</em>. This is, 
among other reasons, to ensure that the customer's confidence in the software 
can remain high.</p>


<hr align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade="">


<h2>Verification</h2>
<p><i>Did I build the thing right?</i> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Have the model and simulation been built so 
that they fully satisfy the developer’s intent (as indicated in specifications)? 
	</li>
	<li>Verification has two aspects: </li>
	<ul>
	<li>design (all specifications and nothing else are 
included in the model or simulation design) </li>
	<li>implementation (all 
specifications and nothing else are included in the model or simulation as 
built).</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<hr align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade="">


<h2>Validation</h2>
<p><i>Did I build the right thing?</i> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Will the model or simulation be able to 
adequately support its intended use? </li>
	<li>Is its fidelity appropriate for that? 
	</li>
	<li>Validation has two aspects:<ul>
	<li>conceptual validation (when the anticipated fidelity 
of the model or simulation conceptual model is assessed) 
	</li>
	<li>results validation 
(when results from the implemented model or simulation are compared with an appropriate referent to demonstrate that the model or simulation can in fact 
support the intended use).</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>

<h2>Personal Observations</h2>
<h2>Everyone <b><i>can write programs</i></b> but not <b><i>everyone can design 
  them</i></b>.</h2>
<ul>
	<li>There are tons of books on <i>programming and design</i> as well on <i>
  cooking and diet</i>.</li>
	<li><em><strong>Imperative</strong></em> (procedural) <strong><em>program</em></strong> in general: a <strong><em>subroutine</em></strong> expressed by: statement concatenation, branching, and looping (<b><i>algorithmic 
	logic</i></b>).</li>
	<li><em><strong>OO program</strong></em>: a <strong><em>structured collection of objects</em></strong> of your object model (<b><i>social 
	metaphor</i></b>)</li>
	<li><em><strong>SO program</strong></em> (distributed program): a <strong><em>structured collection of net subroutines </em></strong>(SPOA)<strong><em> and/or objects</em></strong> (SOOA)</li>
	<li>Be pragmatic
  <ul>
    <li><b>modularize - commonality and loose coupling</b></li>
    <li><b>encapsulate - variability and cohesiveness</b></li>
    <li><b>manage process - cone of uncertainty so listen to the customer</b></li>
